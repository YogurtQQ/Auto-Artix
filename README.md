# Auto-Artix
(personal) Post-install necessary stuff for Artix Linux

## Personal
This not only contains a script to install necessary things after installing Artix Linux, but also this:

- [Package list](https://github.com/YogurtQQ/Auto-Artix/blob/main/package.list): A collection of my favorite software that I always use, so I want it to be installed as soon as possible.
- [Keyboard bindings](https://github.com/YogurtQQ/Auto-Artix/blob/main/dconf-settings.conf): The configuration for my Cinnamon DE shortcuts. Some of them are similar to i3-wm, as Alt+Q for closing windows, Alt+Enter for terminal, and more:

## Keyboard bindings
#### Basic
A-z = flameshot gui (screenshot software)  
A-x = open the default file manager  
A-enter = open terminal  
A-c = not binded, but may use it for 'command execute' or web browser  
A-e = not binded, but may use it for logout menu
#### Windows
A-q = close window  
A-r = resize window  
C-A-space = maximize window
